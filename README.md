## thanks

- nornagon who made the initial plugin (albeit it was not really working) - this plugin is built upon his work (https://github.com/nornagon/dokku-git-rev)
- mlebkowski/puck who helped me out and made the initial verison of the receive-app based version. I based this version upon that idea and made it bug free and more stable (https://github.com/mlebkowski/dokku-git-rev/tree/fix/first-push)
